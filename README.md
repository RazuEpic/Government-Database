# Government-Database
To add more people to the database, create a '.txt' file for each individual with their details listed on separate lines in the format required for either the 'Jail_Database' or 'Officer_Databasel. For a jail record, the fields include name, job, age, race, crime, months incarcerated, jail facility, incarceration status, sex offender registry status, and probation status. For an officer record, the fields include name, race, position, titles, badge number, age, department, years on the force, number of arrests, firearm used, confirmed kills, employment status, and whether they’ve been fired. Once the '.txt' files are created, add them to the 'database_list' using the 'from_file' function with the corresponding class ('Jail_Database' or 'Officer_Database'). Don’t forget to update the menu prompt to include the new person’s details for user selection.
