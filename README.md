To add more criminals to the database, create a `.txt` file for each individual with their details listed on separate lines. The required fields include name, job, age, race, crime, months incarcerated, jail facility, incarceration status, sex offender registry status, and probation status. Once the `.txt` file is created, add it to the `database_list` using the `from_file` function with the `Jail_Database` class. Be sure to update the menu prompt to include the new criminal’s details for user selection.

To add more police officers to the database, create a `.txt` file with the officer’s details listed on separate lines. The required fields include name, race, position, titles, badge number, age, department, years on the force, number of arrests, firearm used, confirmed kills, employment status, and whether they’ve been fired. After creating the `.txt` file, add it to the `database_list` using the `from_file` function with the `Officer_Database` class. Update the menu prompt to include the new officer’s details for user selection.
